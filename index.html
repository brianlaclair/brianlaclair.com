                        <p>Hi there! ðŸ‘‹</p>
                        <p>I'm Brian, a full stack software developer based in Burlington, Vermont. I started coding when I was a kid (by finding an ancient QBASIC executable when I was 9) and haven't stopped since.</p>
                        <p>I've always been fascinated by creating things, and to me, programming is an avenue where the physical barriers of making is stripped away and you can have unparalleled levels of creative possibility spring to life.</p>
                        <p>Occasionally I also take <a href="https://instagram.com/brianlaclair">photos</a> and make <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2b51b542ccni3Pm9spKHKC">alternative-rock music</a>.</p>
                        <p>Let's get in touch ðŸ‘‡</p>
